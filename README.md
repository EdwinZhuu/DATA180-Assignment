# Calculator APP
The APP was created for one of my other CMPT classes. The purpose is to be able to take grades and their worth and calculate what students are currently getting in the class. 

## Function ##
The application takes the grade for an assignment as well as the weight to tell the student what grade they are currently at. The weight is optional as giving just the grade will work too.

## User Interface ##
